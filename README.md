# Creating responsive tours and travel website
Title: Creating a Responsive Tours and Travel Website using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript
Developed a fully responsive travel agency website using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript from scratch. The website features a responsive header/navbar with toggle menu bar effect, search bar, and login/register form. The home section has a responsive hero section with a video slider created using vanilla JavaScript. The website also includes a responsive book section, packages section, services section, gallery with hover effect section, review section with touch slider, contact section, brand section with touch slider, and a responsive footer section.
Created a complete and responsive travel website design from scratch using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Successfully implemented advanced features like a video slider and touch slider for a seamless user experience. Used flexbox to make sections like book, packages, services, gallery, and review responsive. Improved my skills in front-end web development, particularly in creating responsive designs.
